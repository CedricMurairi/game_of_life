<h1> Assignment 8</h1>
As Usual , congratulations on the work that you have done in the previous work, Kudos :)<br><br>

Let's play<br>
This assignment is simple ,since you have everything designed on paper ,
what you have to do is to code everything you wrote and all the tests<br>

<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
This is how I am going to grade you ,<br>
I will first run your tests , if you have all the tests (at least five for each class) ,
and they are running fine you get 50%<br>
Well commenting of your code 20% ,<br>
What I mean by proper commenting is that at the top of each class you say what the class is doing. <br>
And at the top of each method you say what the method is doing<br>
Proper naming of classes and variables 20%<br>
Well documented Read me <br>
What do I mean? ,it should say what you are working on,and if there are modules that<br>
you used that the user needs to install to be able to run your code , you need to mention that. 5%<br>
Putting the author of the file ,on the top of that file (eg: author: Ella Ty Karambizi) ,<br>
5% if it is both of you , you can put both of your names on the top. Be honest :)<br>
Go my Giants , go get me hundreds :)<br><br>


Have Fun :)
